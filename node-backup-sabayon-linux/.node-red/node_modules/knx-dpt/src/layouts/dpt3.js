 dimming actuator switched on, moving from actual value in direction of
 set value
 Events

 position = 1        on command
 control = up dX     command, dX more bright dimming
 control = down dX   command, dX less bright dimming

 value = 0           dimming value = off
 value = x%          dimming value = x% (not zero)
 value_reached       actual value reached set value

 The step size dX for up and down dimming may be 1/1, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16, 1/32 and 1/64 of
 the full dimming range (0 - FFh).
