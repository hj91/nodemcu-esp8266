# mdashboard


[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/node-red-contrib-mdashboard.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/node-red-contrib-mdashboard)
Note that this is not the official node-red-dashboard. This is a fork which solves a very specific requirement- widget
state is emitted only to the socket origin that caused the change. For example, if two users have the same dashboard open
and one user types into a text input, the other user will not get the text update. This works well when a typical web form
like behavior is needed- multiple users can use the same dashboard url as a form to submit data back to the flow. This
version of the dashboard can be installed along with the original node-red-dashboard- the UI configuration for the two
dashboards are distinct and the settings appear in different tabs in the sidebar. Note that this changes the behavior of
the original node-red-dashboard - specifically, one user's changes could overwrite another's without them knowing about it.
In that sense, this dashboard is multi-user only for input- all dashboard users still share the same backend instance.

Most of the documentation is left as is from the original project as it is applicable to the current project as well.

This module provides a set of nodes in Node-RED to quickly create a live data
dashboard.

## Pre-requisites

mDashboard requires Node-RED version 0.14 or more recent.

## Install

To install the stable version use the `Menu - Manage palette` option and search for `node-red-contrib-mdashboard`.

Open your Node-RED instance and you should have UI nodes available in the palette and a new `mdashboard` tab in the
right side panel. The UI interface is available at <http://localhost:1880/mui> (if the default settings are used).

## Layout

The dashboard layout should be considered as a grid.

Each **group** element has a width - by default 6 'units' (a unit is 48px wide by default with a 6px gap).

Each **widget** in the group also has a width - by default, 'auto' which means it will fill the width of the group it is in, but you can set it to a fixed number of units.

The layout algorithm of the dashboard always tries to place items as high and to the left as they can within their container - this applies to how groups are positioned on the page, as well as how widgets are positioned in a group.

Given a group with width 6, if you add six widgets, each with a width of 2, then they will be laid out in two rows - three widgets in each.

If you add two groups of width 6, as long as your browser window is wide enough, they will sit alongside each other. If you shrink the browser, at some point the second group will shift to be below the first, in a column.

It is advisable to use multiple groups if possible, rather than one big group, so that the page can dynamically resize on smaller screens.

## Features

#### Dashboard sidebar

The widget layout is managed by a `mdashboard` tab in the sidebar of the Node-RED editor.

##### Layout

 - **Tabs** - From here you can re-order the tabs, groups and widgets, and add and edit their properties.

 - **Links** - to other web pages can also be added to the menu. They can optionally be opened in an iframe - if allowed by the target page.

##### Theme

 - **Style** - the theme and font of the UI is set in the dashboard sidebar. You can select a default Light, Dark or Custom Theme. You cannot have different themes for each tab.

##### Site

 - **Title** - the `title` of the UI page can be set.

 - **Options** - optionally hide the title bar, and allow swiping sideways between tabs on a touch screen.

 - **Sizes** - sets the basic geometry of the grid layout in pixels. The **width** and **height** of widgets can be set, as can the width of *groups*. These are the basic definitions of the "units' used elsewhere within the dashboard.

#### Widgets

Group labels are optional.

Most widgets can have a label and value - both of these can be specified by properties of the incoming msg if required, and modified by angular filters. For example the label can be set to `{{msg.topic}}`, or the value could be set to `{{value | number:1}}%` to round the value to one decimal place and append a % sign.

Each node may parse the `msg.payload` to make it suitable for display. This converted version is exposed as the variable called `value`, (see example above).

Any widget can be disabled by passing in a `msg.enabled` property set to `false;`. *Note:* this doesn't stop the widget receiving messages but does stop inputs being active and does re-style the widget.

Most ui widgets can also be configured by using a `msg.ui_control` message - see **[config-fields.md](https://github.com/umasudhan/node-red-contrib-mdashboard/blob/master/config-fields.md)**
for further details.

  - **Audio out** - a widget that will let you play audio (wav or mp3) or send Text to Speech (TTS) to the client.
  - **Button** - the icon can be set using either Material or fa-icons - the colour and background colour may also be set. If the widget is sized to 1 wide the icon has precedence.
  - **Chart** - has both line, bar and pie chart modes. Also the X-Axis labels can be customised using a date formatter string. See **[this document](https://github.com/node-red/node-red-dashboard/blob/master/Charts.md)** for more information on the chart data formats accepted.
  - **Colour Picker** - a colour picker widget.
  - **Date Picker** - a date picker widget. The displayed Date format can be specified in the Site tab using moment.js formatting.
  - **Dropdown** - a dropdown select widget has been added. Multiple label, value pairs can be specified. The choices can also be set via `msg.options` containing an array of objects. If just text then the value will be the same as the label, otherwise you can specify both by using an object of "label":"value" pairs :

        [ "Choice 1", "Choice 2", {"Choice 3": 3} ]

     Setting `msg.payload` will pre-select the value in the dropdown.
  - **Form** - a widget that can be composed of several sub-widgets. When submitted all values are submitted as a single message.
  - **Gauge** - has 4 modes - *standard* (simple gauge), *donut* (complete 360&deg;), *compass*, and *wave*. You can also specify the colour range of the standard and donut gauges.
  - **Notification** - creates alerts to the user - can either be a toast popup, or a dismissable alert box. The alert may be targeted to a single user.
  - **Numeric** - a Numeric input widget with up/down buttons.
  - **Slider** - a simple horizontal slider, with variable step size.
  - **Switch** - can also set two icons and/or colours depending on state.
  - **Template** - the template node allows the user to specify and create their own widgets within the framework using HTML, Javascript. This is an Angular.js widget. You may also use this to override the built in CSS styles.
  - **Text** - A read only widget, the layout of the `label`, and `value` can be configured.
  - **Text input** - text input box, with optional label, can also support password, email and colour modes.
  - **UI-Control** - allows some dynamic control of the dashboard. Sending a `msg.payload` of the tab number (from 0) or name will switch to that tab. Outputs a `msg.payload` for every browser *connection* and *loss*, that can be used to trigger other actions.

**Tip:** The *Text* widget will accept html - so you can use it together with the *fa-icons* we
already use to create indicator type widgets.


## Multiple Users

This Dashboard supports multiple individual users- see note at top. If a widget state on a dashboard changes, the event is emitted only to the dashboard from which it originated.
