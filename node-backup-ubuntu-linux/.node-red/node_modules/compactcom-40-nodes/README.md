# compactcom-40-nodes

This is a package including a Node-RED node to read module information and application data
instances of an [Anybus CompactCom 40](http://www.anybus.com/products/embedded-index) enabled device.

## Installation

Run npm -g install compactcom-40-nodes

## Pre-requisites

The node uses the [Request](https://github.com/request/request) library for http requests and
the [Async](https://github.com/caolan/async) library to handle sequences and parallel executions.

## Features

The node can be configured with an Anybus enabled device by name, an IP address
and authentication data together with a comma separated list of application data
instances to fetch from the device. Multiple instances of a node can share a single
device configuration. If the node is not configured the IP address and application
data instances list can also be set in the incoming message to the node. This allows
the Node-RED flow to dynamically set the IP address and application data instances
list during the execution of the flow. The node outputs a message with a key/value
object including both module information and a list of the application data
instances with information and data values.

Anybus modules from HMS are available for connection to industrial Ethernet protocols like Profinet, EtherNet/IP(TM), EtherCAT, and Modbus-TCP etc.
