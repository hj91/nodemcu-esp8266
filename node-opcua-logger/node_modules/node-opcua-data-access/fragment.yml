AxisInformation:
  engineeringUnits: >
              EngineeringUnit         Holds the information about the engineering units for a given axis.
  euRange:         >
              Range                   Limits of the range of the axis
  title:            >
              LocalizedText           User readable axis title, useful when the units are %, the Title may be “Particle size distribution"
  axisScaleType:    >
              AxisScaleEnumeration    LINEAR, LOG, LN, defined by AxisSteps
  axisSteps:        >
              Double[]                Specific value of each axis steps, may be set to “Null” if not used

EngineeringUnit:
   document: >
       Units of measurement for  AnalogItems that represent continuously- variable physical quantities   ( e.g.,
       length, mass , time, temperature )
       NOTE  This standard defines Properties to inform about the unit used for the  DataItem
       value and about  the highest and lowest value likely to be obtained in normal operation

  fields:
    namespaceUri: >
            Identifies the organization (company, standards organization) that defines the EUInformation.

    unitId: >
            Identifier for programmatic evaluation. −1 is used if a unitId is not available.
            The displayName of the engineering unit is typically the abbreviation of the
            engineering unit, for example ”h” for hour or ”m/s” for meter per second." +
    description: >
                  Contains the full name of the engineering unit such as ”hour” or ”meter per second"
    displayName: >
                  The displayName of the engineering  ( for instance 'm/s' )"
