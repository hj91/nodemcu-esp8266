 * This Service is used to call (invoke) a list of Methods. Each method call is invoked within the context
 * of an existing Session. If the Session is terminated, the results of the methodâ€™s execution cannot be
 * returned to the Client and are discarded. This is independent of the task actually performed at the
 * Server.
 * This Service provides for passing input and output arguments to/from a method. These arguments
 * are defined by Properties of the method.
